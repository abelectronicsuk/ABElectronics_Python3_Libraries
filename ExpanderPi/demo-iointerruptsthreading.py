# ================================================
# ABElectronics Expander Pi | - IO Interrupts Demo
# Version 1.0 Created 26/06/2015
# Version 1.1 Updated 11/06/2017 updated to include changes to Expander Pi library
#
# Requires python smbus to be installed with: sudo apt-get install python3-smbus
#
# run with: sudo python3 demo-iointerruptsthreading.py
# ================================================

# This example shows how to use the interrupt methods with threading on the Expander Pi IO port.
# The interrupts will be enabled and set so that pin 1 will trigger INT A and B.
# Internal pull-up resistors will be used so grounding one of the pins will trigger the interrupt
# using the read_interrupt_capture or reset_interrupts methods will reset the interrupts.


# Initialise the IOPi and create an instance called io.
