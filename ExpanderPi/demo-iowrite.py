ABElectronics Expander Pi | Digital I/O Interrupts Demo
Version 1.0 Created 21/08/2014
Version 1.1 Updated 11/06/2017 updated to include changes to Expander Pi library

Requires python smbus to be installed with: sudo apt-get install python3-smbus
run with: sudo python3 demo-iowrite.py
================================================

This example uses the write_pin and writeBank methods to switch the pins
on and off on the I/O bus.

Initialise the IO class and create an instance called io.
